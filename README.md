Introduction: This is a project for my CS 5343.001 - Algorithm Analysis and Data Structures course
Displays a maze as described in the textbook.  The program is a command-line program that generates a character-based maze

     The user should be able to specify the number of rows and columns in the maze, at least up to 20x20.
      
     Used the DisjSet class from the textbook to implement the textbook's algorithm. The DisjSet class must be used as given in the textbook without making modifications to it.
